CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email_encrypted BYTEA[],
    phone_encrypted BYTEA[],
    company VARCHAR(255),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    address_encrypted JSONB,
    tags TEXT[],
    custom_fields JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID NOT NULL,
    last_modified_by UUID NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Audit log for compliance
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    table_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    record_id UUID NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
