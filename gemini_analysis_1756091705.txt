The `ContactService` class in `backend/src/services/contact.service.ts` is responsible for handling business logic related to contact management. It interacts with `ContactRepository` for data persistence and `redisConnection` for caching.

Here's a thorough analysis:

**1. What methods are fully implemented vs. stubs:**

All methods within `ContactService` are **fully implemented**. There are no obvious stubs or placeholders. Each method contains logic for its stated purpose, including interactions with the repository, caching, and error handling.

**2. Whether it properly uses `ContactRepository` and `UserRepository`:**

*   **`ContactRepository`**: The `ContactService` properly uses `ContactRepository`. It injects `ContactRepository` in its constructor and calls various methods like `createContact`, `verifyOwnership`, `updateByUser`, `deleteByUser`, `findByUserId`, `findFavoritesByUser`, `findByUserAndStatus`, `findByUserAndCompany`, `findByUserAndTags`, `searchByUser`, `getCompaniesByUser`, `getTagsByUser`, `getContactStatsByUser`, `bulkUpdateByUser`, `exportByUser`, `findPotentialDuplicates`. The interactions are appropriate for a service layer delegating data access to a repository.
*   **`UserRepository`**: The `ContactService` **does not directly use `UserRepository`**. Its interactions are solely with `ContactRepository` and `redisConnection`. This is appropriate as `ContactService`'s primary concern is contacts, and user-related data (like user roles for permission checks) is expected to be available via the `req.user` object passed from middleware or handled by the `ContactRepository`'s `verifyOwnership` method (which implicitly relies on user data).

**3. Which service methods are production-ready:**

Most service methods are well-implemented and appear production-ready in terms of core functionality, error handling, and logging.

*   **Core CRUD (`createContact`, `getContactById`, `listContacts`, `updateContact`, `deleteContact`)**: These are robust, including ownership verification, duplicate checks (for email), and comprehensive error handling. Caching is integrated for `getContactById` and `listContacts`, and cache invalidation is handled on modifications.
*   **Status/Favorite Toggles (`archiveContact`, `restoreContact`, `toggleFavorite`)**: These are effectively implemented by leveraging the `updateContact` method, ensuring consistency and proper cache invalidation.
*   **Tag Management (`addTag`, `removeTag`)**: These methods correctly fetch the contact, modify its tags, and then update it via `updateContact`, ensuring data integrity and cache updates.
*   **Query/Filter Methods (`getFavorites`, `getContactsByStatus`, `getContactsByCompany`, `getContactsByTags`, `searchContacts`)**: These methods correctly delegate to the `ContactRepository` for data retrieval, supporting various filtering and search criteria.
*   **Statistical/Aggregate Data (`getContactStats`, `getCompanies`, `getTags`)**: These methods efficiently retrieve aggregate data from the repository.
*   **Bulk Operations (`bulkUpdateContacts`, `exportContacts`)**: These are implemented with proper ownership verification and cache invalidation, crucial for efficiency in production.
*   **Duplicate Management (`findDuplicates`, `mergeDuplicates`)**: `findDuplicates` correctly identifies potential duplicates. `mergeDuplicates` handles the merging logic, including updating the primary contact and deleting duplicates, with ownership verification.
*   **Import (`importContacts`)**: This method iterates through provided contact data, attempts to create each contact, and reports successful and failed imports. It handles errors gracefully for individual imports.

**Areas for consideration/improvement for full production readiness:**

*   **PII Encryption/Decryption**: This is the most critical missing piece. The `Contact` model and `ContactRepository` are designed with `email_encrypted`, `phone_encrypted`, and `address_encrypted` fields (as `BYTEA[]` or `JSONB` in the DB schema). However, the `ContactService` (and the `Contact` model itself) does not explicitly perform encryption before sending data to the repository or decryption after receiving it. The current implementation would likely store unencrypted data in encrypted fields or cause database errors if the DB expects encrypted byte arrays. An `EncryptionService` should be integrated here to handle the encryption/decryption of sensitive fields (email, phone, address) before `createContact` and `updateContact` send data to the repository, and after `getContactById` and `listContacts` retrieve data.
*   **Robustness of `importContacts`**: While functional, `importContacts` processes contacts sequentially. For very large imports, this could be slow and tie up the main thread. In a high-volume production environment, this might be better handled by a background job/queue system.
*   **Cache Strategy for `listContacts`**: The `listContacts` method caches results only if there's no `search` term and no `filters`. This is a reasonable optimization, but a more sophisticated caching strategy might involve caching search results or filtered lists for a shorter duration, or using a more granular cache invalidation strategy (e.g., invalidating specific search queries when a contact changes).
*   **Error Handling for `bulkUpdateContacts` and `importContacts`**: While they report success/failure counts, the `errors` array in `ImportResult` or the `failed` count in `bulkUpdateContacts` might need more detailed error messages for debugging or user feedback in a production setting.
*   **Concurrency in `mergeDuplicates`**: For high-concurrency scenarios, `mergeDuplicates` might need explicit transaction management or optimistic locking to prevent race conditions if multiple users try to merge the same contacts simultaneously. (The `BaseRepository` does have `executeTransaction`, but it's not explicitly used in `mergeDuplicates` in the provided code snippet, though it might be used by underlying repository calls).

**4. Any missing dependencies or integrations:**

*   **Encryption Service Integration**: As highlighted above, an `EncryptionService` is a critical missing dependency/integration for handling PII encryption/decryption. The current code implies its existence (e.g., `encryptionService.encryptArray` in `backend/src/services/__tests__/contact.service.test.ts`), but it's not explicitly used in `backend/src/services/contact.service.ts` itself, nor is it injected in the constructor. This is the most significant gap for security and data integrity.
*   **Background Job/Queue System**: For large-scale operations like `importContacts` or `exportContacts` (if they become very large), integrating with a background job/queue system (e.g., BullMQ, RabbitMQ, Kafka) would be beneficial to offload heavy processing from the main API thread and provide better user experience (e.g., showing progress, sending notifications upon completion).
*   **Email Service**: While not directly a dependency of `ContactService`, a production application would likely integrate an `EmailService` (like the one in `backend/src/services/email.service.ts`) to send notifications related to contact imports/exports or changes.

In summary, `ContactService` is well-structured and largely functional, demonstrating good design principles. The primary concern for production readiness is the explicit handling of PII encryption/decryption, which is crucial for data security and compliance.
