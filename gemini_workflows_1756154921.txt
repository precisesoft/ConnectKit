Here's an analysis of the GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory:

**1. `accessibility.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `workflow_dispatch` (manual), `pull_request` (branches: `main`, `develop`), `push` (branches: `main`), `schedule` (daily at 3 AM UTC).
*   **Branch Execution**: This workflow *would* run on the `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` branch if a Pull Request is opened from it targeting `main` or `develop`, or if manually triggered via `workflow_dispatch`. It would *not* run on direct pushes to `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline`.
*   **Purpose**: Performs comprehensive accessibility testing using Lighthouse, Axe-core, and custom WAVE-style, color contrast, and keyboard navigation tests. It consolidates results into a report.
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow is directly relevant to accessibility testing, so it should **not** be disabled.

**2. `ci.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `push` (branches: `main`, `develop`), `pull_request` (branches: `main`, `develop`), `workflow_dispatch` (manual).
*   **Branch Execution**: This workflow *would* run on the `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` branch if a Pull Request is opened from it targeting `main` or `develop`, or if manually triggered. It would *not* run on direct pushes to `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline`.
*   **Purpose**: This is the main Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. It includes security scanning (Trivy), backend unit/lint/type checks, frontend unit/lint/type checks, application build, Docker image build (on push events), and End-to-End (E2E) tests (on pull requests).
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow provides essential quality gates. Disabling it is **not recommended** as it sacrifices code quality assurance. If performance is a concern, consider optimizing specific jobs within this workflow (e.g., using path filters for jobs) rather than disabling the entire pipeline.

**3. `compliance-federal.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `schedule` (daily at 1 AM UTC), `workflow_dispatch` (manual, with inputs for compliance suite and severity).
*   **Branch Execution**: This workflow would **not** run on the `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` branch automatically. It is only triggered by schedule or manual dispatch.
*   **Purpose**: Conducts federal compliance checks, including FIPS 140-2 cryptography validation, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and analysis, enhanced Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with Semgrep, authenticated Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and PII detection. It generates a comprehensive compliance report.
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow does not run automatically on feature branches, so it is **safe to leave enabled**.

**4. `deploy.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `push` (branches: `main`, tags: `v*`), `workflow_dispatch` (manual, with environment input).
*   **Branch Execution**: This workflow would **not** run on the `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` branch automatically. It is specifically for deployments to `main` or tagged releases.
*   **Purpose**: Manages automated deployment to staging and production environments, including Docker image build and push, and post-deployment health checks.
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow is for deployment and does not run on feature branches. It is **safe to leave enabled**.

**5. `nightly.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `schedule` (daily at 2 AM UTC), `workflow_dispatch` (manual, with test suite and duration inputs).
*   **Branch Execution**: This workflow would **not** run on the `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` branch automatically. It is only triggered by schedule or manual dispatch.
*   **Purpose**: Runs extended tests including performance, security, chaos engineering, data integrity, and backup/restore tests. It consolidates results into a nightly report.
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow does not run automatically on feature branches, so it is **safe to leave enabled**.

**6. `performance.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `workflow_dispatch` (manual, with test duration and max users inputs), `schedule` (daily at 2 AM UTC).
*   **Branch Execution**: This workflow would **not** run on the `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` branch automatically. The file itself indicates it's `(Disabled)` for automatic `push` and `pull_request` triggers.
*   **Purpose**: Performs various performance tests, including Lighthouse CI, k6 load testing, database performance, bundle size analysis, and profiling.
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow is already configured not to run automatically on `push` or `pull_request` events. It is **safe to leave as is**.

**7. `sbom-utils.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `workflow_call` (reusable workflow).
*   **Branch Execution**: This is a reusable workflow, meaning it is designed to be called by other workflows (e.g., `compliance-federal.yml`). It does not trigger on its own.
*   **Purpose**: Provides reusable steps for SBOM generation and vulnerability analysis.
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow is a utility and does not run independently. It is **safe to leave enabled**.

**8. `security.yml`**
*   **Triggers**: `workflow_dispatch` (manual), `push` (branches: `main`, `develop`), `pull_request` (branches: `main`, `develop`), `schedule` (daily at 1 AM UTC).
*   **Branch Execution**: This workflow *would* run on the `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` branch if a Pull Request is opened from it targeting `main` or `develop`, or if manually triggered. It would *not* run on direct pushes to `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline`.
*   **Purpose**: Conducts comprehensive security testing, including dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit), container security scanning (Trivy), frontend security checks (ESLint security plugin, sensitive data in build), backend security checks (ESLint security plugin, hardcoded secrets), OWASP ZAP scan (on push to main), and security headers testing. It consolidates results into a security report.
*   **Temporary Disablement**: This workflow performs critical security checks. Disabling it is **not recommended** as it would bypass important security validations. If performance is a concern, consider optimizing the security checks (e.g., using path filters for jobs) rather than disabling the entire workflow.

**Summary of Workflows Running on `fix/accessibility-testing-pipeline` (via PR to `main`/`develop`):**
*   `accessibility.yml`: Yes
*   `ci.yml`: Yes
*   `security.yml`: Yes

**Workflows Safe to Temporarily Disable for Accessibility Testing (Performance Focus):**
Given the current configuration, `compliance-federal.yml`, `deploy.yml`, `nightly.yml`, `performance.yml`, and `sbom-utils.yml` do not automatically run on feature branch PRs or are already disabled for such events. Therefore, no action is needed for these.

For `ci.yml` and `security.yml`, while they *could* be temporarily disabled to speed up PR checks, it is **strongly advised against** as it compromises code quality and security. The current setup where these workflows only trigger on PRs (not direct pushes to the feature branch) already provides a good balance, allowing fast local iteration while ensuring comprehensive checks before merging.
